The [Abaqus Learning Edition](https://edu.3ds.com/en/software/abaqus-learning-edition) is available free of charge to anyone and can be downloaded from the [SIMULIA Community](https://r1132100503382-eu1-3dswym.3dexperience.3ds.com/#community:39/wiki:_NXifU43Q7yHzTiCX9yEaw). The Abaqus Learning Edition package contains:

- Abaqus/CAE.

In the ABAQUS Learning Edition the model size is limited up to 1000 nodes. The features like user subroutines and C++ ODB API are not available. Parallel execution is not available as well.

Abaqus Learning Edition files (\*.cae and \*.odb) are compatible with the academic version but not with commercial Abaqus releases.

The Abaqus Learning Edition is officially available on Windows platform only but it can be run successfully on Linux using Wine.

Please find below the procedure of Abaqus Learning Edition installation and running on Linux using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/). The installer of the ABAQUS Learning Edition requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 but the Wine doesn't support MS IE 10 (or later). However, the Abaqus Learning Edition installer can be run in the alternative way to overcome it.

## Install Wine
